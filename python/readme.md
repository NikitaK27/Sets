# Introduction to Set
# Explanation 
- Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

- Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

- A set is a collection which is both unordered and unindexed.

- Sets are written with curly brackets.
```
myset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```
# Syntax
- Create a Set:
```
set = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
```
- Get the number of items in a set:
```
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print(len(thisset))
```
- Set items can be of any data type:
```
  set1 = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
  set2 = {1, 5, 7, 9, 3}
  set3 = {True, False, False}
```
